For the above-mentioned years,the data is available in [different tables](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final) and these tables categorise the data differently. We have used Table1, since it categorises the hate criimes against religion into different religions, which is most appropriate for this project.

    "As shown in the graph above, the number of hate_crimes against all religion fluctuated by going up and down in between 1996 and 2008, with a very high peak in 2011. Since 2008, the number has seen a consistent and steady decrease. It is the same year, Barrack Obama got elected as the President of the United States. The average number of crimes before 2011 were 1412, and after 2011 they were 1288. In 2011, there were 1828, and most of the stark increase can be contributed towards the stark increase in the hate crimes against Muslims."

Hate crimes targetting Muslims as a ratio of the hate-crimes motivated by religion has increased a lot in 2011 because of September-11 terrorist attack.Before, 2011, it was below 3% consistently, and in 2011 it went beyond 25%. After 2011, it never went down to its pre-2011 number. This also shows that the September-11 incident has increased the general sentiment against Muslims, and even after over a decade, the effect of September-11 on hate crimes against Muslims is clearly evident. Moreover, we can also see that the ratio has been rising in recent years showing that even though the number of hate-crimes against religions as a whole are decreasing, among those numbers, the ratio of attacks on Muslims in increaseing."

    "The number of hate crime incidents against Muslims have fluctuated a lot over the years. The most striking number of incidents took place in 2011 as shown by the graph above. Before 2011, the maximum number of incidents were 32, and the minimum were 211. In 2011, the number of incidents were 481. After 2011, the max number of incidents were 156, and the minimum were 105. In recent years, the hate crimes against Muslims have started to rise again.From 1995 to 2014, the number of incidents changed as shown above.\n",
    "September-11 Terrorist Attack had a huge impact on the number of hate-crimes against Muslims. The incident took place in 2011, where there were 481 hate crimes against Muslims, as opposed to 28 in 2010. The number of hate crimes against Muslims increased by more than 16 times (1672%) in 2011 as compared to 2010. In the following year (2012), the number of hate crimes against Muslims decreased by almost 68%. The average number of hate crimes against Muslims were 27 before 2011, and after 2011, they have increased to an average of 142. The average number of hate crimes against Muslims increased by more than 4 times (421%).\n",
    "As shown in the 3rd graph above, the number of hate_crimes against all religion fluctuated by going up and down in between 1996 and 2008, with a very high peak in 2011. Since 2008, the number has seen a consistent and steady decrease. It is the same year, Barrack Obama got elected as the President of the United States. The average number of crimes before 2011 were 1412, and after 2011 they were 1288. In 2011, there were 1828, and most of the stark increase can be contributed towards the stark increase in the hate crimes against Muslims.\n",
